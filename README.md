## Who we are:

High school classmates with diverse backgrounds but common interests in this cherry tree peak bloom competition. We share our different knowledge and skills to promote a better statistical phenological cherry peak bloom prediction model considering both theoretical biology insights and robust practical algorithms.
We are a group of people who enjoy data science and love applying our knowledge to real-life scenarios. We hope that our work could provide more insights or inspirations to the area of statistical phenological study.
