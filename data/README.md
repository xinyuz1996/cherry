# Cleaned data sets

The structure of the cleaned data files is as follows:

* _location_ location identifier (`string`)
* _lat_ (approximate) latitude of the observation (`double`).
* _long_ (approximate) longitude of the observation (`double`).
* _alt_ (approximate) altitude of the observation (`double`).
* _year_ year of the observation (`integer`).
* *bloom_date* date of peak bloom of the cherry trees (ISO 8601 date `string`). The "peak bloom date" may be defined differently for different locations.
* *bloom_doy* days since January 1st of the year until peak bloom (`integer`). January 1st is `1`.

## Data sources

### Washington, D.C. (USA)

The data in file *washingntondc.csv* has been obtained from https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/cherry-blossoms.
The latitude and longitude correspond to the location of the [Tidal Basin in Washington, DC](https://www.nps.gov/articles/dctidalbasin.htm) and the cherry trees are approximately at sea level (altitude 0).

The peak bloom date is defined as the day when **70%** of the Yoshino Cherry (Prunus x yedoensis) are in full bloom, as determined by the [National Park Service](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/cherryblossom/bloom-watch.htm).

### Liestal-Weideli (Switzerland)

The data in the file *liestal.csv* is 
The cherry trees in Liestal-Weideli are of species _Prunus avium_ (wild cherry).

The peak bloom date is defined as the day when **25%** of the blossoms are in full bloom.
The date is determined by MeteoSwiss.

### Kyoto (Japan)

The data has been obtained from http://atmenv.envi.osakafu-u.ac.jp/aono/kyophenotemp4/.
The geographical location (longitude, latitude, altitude) roughly corresponds to the Nakanoshima area of the Arashiyama Park in Kyoto, Japan.

The peak bloom date of the Prunus jamasakura is determined by a local news paper in Arashiyama (Kyoto, JP).
Data prior to 1888 is extracted from various descriptions or estimated.
